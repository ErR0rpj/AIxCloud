# NLP (Natural Language Processing) Notes
Currently notes are made from: 
1. Prof. Ghassemi Lectures and Tutorials - YouTube
2. ErR0rpj/nlp-class: A Natural Language Processing course taught by Professor Ghassemi (github.com) 

## Introduction
Natural language refers to what we interpret through our senses through language.

For eg. If we say "Tree" then first things come to mind is a tree like Pine tree, Banyan tree, Mango tree, Palm tree, etc but each person will think of a different tree depending upon his/her circumstances and experiences. Now if we say "Red Tree" then the image in our mind suddenly changes to a tree with red leaves.

From the above example we see that a single word can have a lot of difference in what we interpret. So, NLP with AI will have a very great impact on the future.

## N-Gram
N-gram is a contiguous sequence of items or words or letters for a given sample of text. It items can be letters, words, syllables, etc. Eg. from the statement: Your television is good.
1. Bi-grams (words): "Your television", "is good", etc.
2. Tri-Grams (letters): "You", "our", "ur ", "r t", etc
